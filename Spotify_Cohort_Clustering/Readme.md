Creating Cohorts of Songs

Problem Scenario:The customer always looks forward to specialized treatment, whether shopping over an e-commerce website or watching Netflix. They want what they might like to see. To keep the customers engaged, it is also crucial for companies to always present the most relevant information.Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media service provider. The company has over 456 million active monthly users, including over 195 million paying subscribers, as of September 2022.The company intends to create cohorts of different songs that will aid in the recommendation of songs to users based on various relevant features.Each cohort would contain similar types of songs.
Problem Objective:
As a data scientist, you should perform exploratory data analysis and perform cluster analysis to create cohorts of songs. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the various factors that contribute to creating a cohort of songs.

Steps to Perform:

Initial data inspection and data cleaning:
Check whether the data has duplicates, missing values, irrelevant(erroneous entries) values, or outliers.

Depending on your findings, clean the data for further processing.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:

Use appropriate visualizations to find out which two albums should be recommended to anyone based on the number of popular songs in an album.
Perform exploratory data analysis to dive deeper into different features of songs and identify the pattern.
Discover how a song's popularity relates to various factors and how this has changed over time.
Comment on the importance of dimensionality reduction techniques,share your ideas and explain your observations.

Perform Cluster Analysis:
Identify the right number of clusters
Use appropriate clustering algorithm
Define each cluster based on the features
